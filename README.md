Is a technique used to simplify a dataset
It is Linear Transformation which chooses new coordinate system for dataset
Greatest variance by dataset comes on first axis
Second greatest variance on second axis
Used for reducing Dimensionality by eliminating the later principal components
Finding patterns in data of high dimension
Let x1,x2,x3,....xn be set of n Nx1 vectors and let X̅ be their average:
